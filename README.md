This repository contains Part 2 of a POE project for KhumaloCraft.

## Overview
In this part of the project, we focus on designing and implementing a robust database schema to manage product information and user data for KhumaloCraft Emporium. The database is integrated with the existing web application to enhance functionality and scalability.

## Benefits of the Database Design
- **Scalability**: The schema is designed to accommodate future growth, allowing for the addition of new products, users, and categories without significant restructuring.
- **Data Integrity**: Foreign keys ensure referential integrity between tables, maintaining data consistency.
- **Performance**: Indexing primary keys improves query performance, essential for handling a growing number of transactions.
